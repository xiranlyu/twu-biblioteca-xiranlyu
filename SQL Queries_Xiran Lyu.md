### Q4 Add the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer', and add yourself as a member. Check out 'The Pragmatic Programmer'. Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out. Also, provide the SQL used to update the database.
```
INSERT INTO book (title) VALUES ('The Pragmatic Programmer');
INSERT INTO member (name) VALUES ('Xiran Lyu');
INSERT INTO checkout_item (member_id, book_id) VALUES ( (SELECT member.id FROM member WHERE member.name = "Xiran Lyu"), (SELECT book.id FROM book WHERE book.title = "The Pragmatic Programmer"));
SELECT member.name FROM member WHERE member.id = (SELECT checkout_item.member_id FROM checkout_item, book WHERE book.id = checkout_item.book_id AND book.title = 'The Pragmatic Programmer');
```

### Q5 Who has checked out more than 1 item? Tip: Research the GROUP BY syntax.
```
SELECT member.name FROM member WHERE member.id in (SELECT checkout_item.member_id FROM checkout_item GROUP BY checkout_item.member_id HAVING COUNT(checkout_item.member_id) > 1);
```
